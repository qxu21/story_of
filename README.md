I've been slowly building a game (or visual novel, depending on who you ask) called *The Story of Rassilon*. I'm making a story game with characters based off any willing people in one of my favorite Discord servers, The Network of Rassilon, composed of a far-reaching network of mutual friends ultimately tracing back to one specific K-8 school. While that community is the target audience, I'm sure others would find it interesting.

It's not done yet, but I'm sending the chapters out as I make them. I think you should check it out: it's got handmade art, writing, and music.

* Game engine: [LOVE2D](https://love2d.org/)
* Art: [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/)
* Music: [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/), with 3x Osc for synths and [drum samples from Contralogic](http://www.contralogic.com/256-nes-samples/)

As of March 2021, this project has been indefinitely shelved, but [I released all the music on Bandcamp](https://thefluffybread.bandcamp.com/album/the-story-of-rassilon), including several unfinished tracks.
